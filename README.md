## Purpose of Our Project
Save Our World is a project built with the desire to cultivate a sense of awareness and responsibility within our community, encouraging individuals to actively participate in the uplifting cause of preserving Earth's environment. With a positive outlook, our initiative aims to inspire a collective commitment to nurturing our planet. Through engaging experiences presented by this virtual reality game, we seek to instill a sense of enthusiasm and hope, inviting everyone to play a constructive role in safeguarding the environment. By exploring the wonders of our Solar System in the game, users can discover the potential of planetary resources to contribute to Earth's restoration, while learning about Earth and the other planets in the Solar System. Through this game, we also help to inspire members of our community to get involved in space research and We aim to foster a spirit of shared responsibility and optimism as we embark on this journey together towards a greener and more sustainable future.

## Tools Utilized
We used technologies such as Unity and the assets included in the Unity asset store, Oculus VR sets, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code to build our project. Unity was the perfect platform for our game development process, as we were able to efficiently create scenes and assets that were used in our VR game. Oculus VR sets helped us test the VR environment that our game runs in. GitHub was an excellent platform to share our code amongst our group to efficiently manage development. Visual Studio was a very good environment to build our C# code for the animations and scripts for our VR game.

## Problems We Faces and How We Overcame Them
During the project our group encountered major challenges, but we overcame each obstacle with teamwork and our desire to learn. One of the biggest challenges was that the group had little to no experience with creating VR games or using the Unity platform. This created a large learning curve that had to be rectified within a few hours. However, with the support of various learning resources found online, we were able to learn more about the game development process and how to develop games on Unity. Once we were able to obtain an Oculus VR headset, we had difficulty with setting up the Meta accounts because of certain policies involved with VR accounts; however, we were able to troubleshoot creating the account with teamwork and research on how to set up an account properly. Initially, learning the controls for the VR was another challenge because we had to code interactions for controls we were unfamiliar with; however, we learned how to code the controls remotely, which helped us learn about efficient code deployment processes and how animations and control-based functions work in the C# programming language. We also experience issues with uploading large files to GutHib repositories, and in the process, we learned about the Git Large File System technology, which allows us to upload large files to GitHub (over 100 MB).
